# Dynamic Quantization

This repository implements dynamic quantization with outlier-aware low-rank adaptation for neural networks. It provides a flexible framework for quantizing model activations while handling outliers through adaptive scaling.

## Features
- Dynamic quantization with configurable bit width
- Outlier detection using power iteration
- Low-rank adaptation for outlier channels
- Model wrapper for easy integration
